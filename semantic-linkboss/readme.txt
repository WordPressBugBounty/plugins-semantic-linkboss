== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does LinkBoss create internal links? =

LinkBoss uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze your content semantically. It identifies contextually relevant opportunities for internal links and suggests appropriate anchor text, ensuring each link adds value for both users and search engines. Our process is different than Linkwhisper which uses keyword based searching.

= Is the GSC Rank Tracker really free? =
Yes. The Google Search Console integration, including rank tracking, analytics, and GSC-based link suggestions, is included for free to help you make better linking decisions.

= Will my links disappear if I delete the plugin? =
**No.** LinkBoss creates real, permanent HTML links in your content. If you deactivate or delete the plugin, your links remain 100% intact. It won't disappear like LinkStorm, Inlinks, Internal Link Juicer etc.

= How does "Existing Sentence" linking work? =
This is a user favorite. Instead of just highlighting a keyword, LinkBoss scans your old posts to find full sentences that are contextually relevant to your target URL. It turns a specific phrase within that existing sentence into a link, making it look completely natural and human-written.

= Does it work with non-English sites? =
Yes! We support over 30 languages (Spanish, German, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Italian, Chinese, Russian, Arabic, and many more) with native semantic understanding for each.

= Is LinkBoss compatible with other SEO tools? =
Yes. It’s compatible with Yoast, Rankmath, SEO Framework, AIOSEO, SEOPress, SlimSEO, Squirrly SEO, Ahrefs, Semrush, Surfer, Ubersuggest,  Link Whisper, Linksy, LinkStorm, LinkBot, Linkilo, Linkter, YARPP, Inlinks, Internal Link Juicer, Interlinks Manager, Twylu etc. You can keep LinkBoss activated while using these.

= Can I fix "Orphan Pages" with this? =
Yes. The Site Visualizer tool highlights orphan pages (posts with zero internal links). You can then use the "Inbound" tool to quickly find other posts that should link to the orphan page.

= How do I prevent over-optimization (Keyword Stuffing)? =
Use the **Anchor Manager**. It highlights if you have used the exact same anchor text too many times or if multiple pages are competing for the same anchor (cannibalization).
